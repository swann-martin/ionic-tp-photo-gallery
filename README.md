# Ionic tp Photo-Gallery #

This practical work was made during a training at [Webforce3 Developper school](https://www.wf3.fr/) in Bordeaux. 
The aim was to create an app allowing the user to take pictures using Ionic Cordova. 
It was the very first day of using this framework.
It is based on the training on Ionic's doc website https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview
